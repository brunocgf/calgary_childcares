# Child Care Information - Usage considerations

This data set comprises a point-in-time data pull – it includes 18 months of data on open child care programs that have an active license during the last month of the quarter.  Data posted for the same time period may not necessarily be identical from one post to the next due to program activity (e.g. an open program in one post is now closed and not reflected in the next post) and data entry modifications. 
Data available includes the following: - Type of Program: child care programs in Alberta are either licensed under the Child Care Licensing Act (and include day care programs, preschool programs, group family child care programs, and out-of-school care programs) or approved by the Child and Family Services Region (approved family day home).
Please Note: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation measures, many listed child care programs were not open or able to operate at full capacity.
 
•	Child care programing changed from program-based to facility-based in February 2021. A facility-based program can have any of the three program types: day care, out of school care and/or preschool programs. Note that family day home agencies, group family child care programs and innovative child care programs were not impacted by this change.
 
•	Inspections occur in licensed child care programs at a minimum of twice a year.

•	Licensing Officers inspect the program to the Child Care Regulations; if non-compliance to the Regulation is found, the Licensing Officer will give the program either a verbal warning or an enforcement action.

•	Depending on the context of the situation, the Licensing Officer and the child care program will ensure that non-compliances are remedied, often through the development and implementation of an Action Plan.

•	Child care programs have the ability to appeal any issued non-compliances that they feel are not warranted within 30 days.

•	Accreditation is available to all licensed day care centres and out-of-school care programs as well as approved family day home agencies in Alberta. Participation in accreditation is voluntary.

•	Accredited programs have completed a rigorous self-evaluation and quality enhancement process, and have been recognized by the Association for Accreditation of Early Learning and Care Services (AELCS) as meeting the accreditation standards of excellence.
